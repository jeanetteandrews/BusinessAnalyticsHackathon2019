# SFU Beedie Business Analytics Hackathon 2019 <br /> 
### Case Context
How do we predict the rate of churn? For this competition, one Canadian telecom company was struggling with the loss of their customers. Given a [sample](https://github.com/jeanetteandrews/hackathon2019/tree/master/Datasets) of 3,750 customers, my team was tasked to predict the rate of churn of an additional 1,250 customers, as well as find the key variables that indicate customer churn. <br /> We were then tasked to present our findings to judges. We were given four hours to complete the hackathon.

### Process
In order to predict the rate of churn, I used R to create four different machine learning models: a decision tree, a random forest, a logistic regression, and a neural network. I then created a lift chart to compare each of the models' accuracy at the 40% sample proportion level. The decision tree was the most accurate model
